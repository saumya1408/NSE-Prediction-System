## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Stock-Price-Prediction.git
   cd Stock-Price-Prediction
   ```

2. **Create and activate virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv lstm_venv
   source lstm_venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\lstm_venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your configuration:
   ```
   FLASK_APP=web_app/app.py
   FLASK_ENV=development
   ```

## 📊 Usage

### Training the Model
```bash
python scripts/lstm_trainer.py
```

### Running the Web Application
```bash
flask run
```
Then open `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser.

### Making Predictions
1. Select a stock symbol from the dropdown
2. Choose the prediction timeframe
3. View the predicted price chart and metrics

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The model combines CNN and LSTM layers for enhanced time-series prediction:

1. **CNN Layers**:
   - Two 1D convolutional layers with ReLU activation
   - Batch normalization and max pooling
   - Feature extraction from time-series data

2. **LSTM Layers**:
   - Two LSTM layers with dropout for regularization
   - Sequence learning and temporal pattern recognition

3. **Dense Layers**:
   - Fully connected layers for final prediction
   - Single output node for price prediction

## 📈 Performance

The model is evaluated using:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- R² Score
